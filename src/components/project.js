It allows users to log daily health entries, highlighting any symptoms they might have, which influences their access to campus facilities via a QR code system. If symptoms are detected, or if the user has been in contact with a COVID-19 case, the QR code for building access will not be generated. The app also manages data for students who are quarantined or under health monitoring. For administrators, the app offers detailed oversight of all entries, with capabilities to edit, delete, or quarantine students based on health reports. This ensures a safe environment for all campus activities by monitoring health risks effectively." }
